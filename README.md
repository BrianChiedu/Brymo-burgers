# Brymo-burgers

## Description
Created a Java restaurant program for a fictional burger restaurant. This program allows users to select burger types, a side and a drink: with the option to specify size. It calculates the total price of the meal by 
checking the burger type, the drink size and toppings chosen and prints out a detailed reciept to console. This program makes great use of enum types, classes and OOP concepts such as inheritance, composition, encapsulation 
and polymorphism to carry out its operations. Improvements will be made in the coming months to make this a full-fledged application.
